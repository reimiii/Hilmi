Right now, I'm trying out both **Java** and **Python**. I've given PHP and Laravel a go in the past, but it didn't seem to stick. I'm not feeling too into it, maybe because my basics in PHP were a little weak. But hey, that's all part of the journey! I'm excited to keep trying out different languages and finding the one that really clicks for me.
