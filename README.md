Hi, I’m Hilmi. I’ve been diving into Java and Docker. Sometimes I tinker with Bash scripts to code smoother.  
I want to try Kotlin...  
Most of my repos are just study notes to keep things from getting lost, so ignore them.  

```java
List<String> languages = List.of("Java", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Bash", "Kotlin (learning)");
Map<String, List<String>> tools = Map.of(
    "Backend", List.of("Spring Boot", "Docker", "Node.js"),
    "Databases", List.of("PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "Redis (basic)"),
    "Version Control", List.of("Git", "GitHub", "GitLab"),
    "Operating Systems", List.of("Linux (Arch-based)", "Windows")
);
```
